## Technologies Used

### Backend
Tip: There is a file named 'Salvus.postman_collection.json', use it to see examples of requests in Postman. If you want to obtain a token, log in to the application, go to the 'developer console' > 'application' > 'Cookies' > '_session'. This is your request authentication token. Remember, it expires quickly for the application's security, so once you get the token, put it in Postman and make your request.

- **Node.js**: Development platform for building the backend server.
- **Express**: Web framework used to create the server and manage routes.
- **Prisma**: ORM used to manage the database and perform efficient queries.
- **AWS SDK**: An Amazon S3 bucket was used for image storage, aiming to reduce server storage and processing by utilizing only the URLs returned by the service.
- **Clerk**: Used for user authentication and authorization.
- **Multer**: Middleware for handling file uploads.
- **MySQL**: Relational database. (entities: products, assets, and user)

### Frontend

- **React.js**: Library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility CSS framework for styling components.
- **Clerk**: Library for authentication and user management.
